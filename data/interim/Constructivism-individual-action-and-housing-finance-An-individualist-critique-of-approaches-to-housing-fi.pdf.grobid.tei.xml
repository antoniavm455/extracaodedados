would be to reduce the interests of that individual to a means.</s><s xml:id="_WBXzd8s">This Kantian notion on the limits to state action has been stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Nozick

and the resultant outcomes, relies on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hayek. Hayek (1948</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, 1967</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1978</ref><ref type="bibr">, 1988)</ref> is concerned to correct what he considers the fallacy of policy constructivism which he suggests pervades collectivist approaches to social and public policy.</s><s xml:id="_3xBbJEf">He states that there is a belief within collectivist approaches that as all institutions have been made by human action they can be remade by further deliberative action.</s><s xml:id="_TPDS9RF">This, according to Hayek, is a fundamental error on the part of policy makers.</s><s xml:id="_PCrShMT">Institutions have developed in a particular way out of the uncoordinated interrelationship of millions of individual actions, none of which of themselves was of fundamental significance.</s><s xml:id="_W2fsRRV">According to Hayek, institutions and entities such as language and markets have developed spontaneously <ref type="bibr">(1960,</ref><ref type="bibr">1982)</ref> from human action rather than by any particular design or plan.</s><s xml:id="_H9Vd9UX">It was the interaction of millions of individuals pursuing their own interests which has led to the current formation of institutions within a society.</s></p><p xml:id="_TfZMJDn"><s xml:id="_cw3nKzT">However, it has become common since the Enlightenment to believe that what has been created by humans can be remade or recreated to suit a different purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hayek, 1967</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hayek, , 1988))</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GFtnpWq">The problem however, as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mises (1981)</ref>, is that the means to calculate the interests of the individuals within this society cannot be collected centrally.</s><s xml:id="_tpeTj7q">There is no satisfactory manner in which the interests of individuals can be differentiated by a large bureaucratic planning entity and the result is standardisation based on certain universal principles which are deemed to apply.</s><s xml:id="_DzzD7xP">In consequence the spontaneity of human interaction is hampered and denigrated.</s><s xml:id="_hBfsfh4">Thus, for Hayek, the problem of policy constructivism is that the very belief that policy can direct human action appears to stifle, it.</s><s xml:id="_EsgQZuX">This, of course, merely serves to make the constructivism ever more necessary.</s></p><p xml:id="_BxVF663"><s xml:id="_AtVeGpc">Whilst this approach has been associated with New Right critiques of the role of the state, this so-called social evolutionary approach is now finding a wider audience including elements of the net-marxist left (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gamble, 1996)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gTTSgw4">The simple causal relations attributed to government action are therefore now being widely questioned and this is beginning to be seen in housing analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Williams, 1997)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_e2XX7p5">However, much of housing research still places government action as the pivotal point around which all other actions flow.</s><s xml:id="_YBpc4dq">Indeed, whilst <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Williams (1997)</ref> discusses the keffects of unforeseen outcomes, he still looks for government action to remedy these effects.</s><s xml:id="_hN23Azt">My aim, whilst only concentrating on the mainstream housing finance literature, is to suggest that this tendency is the primary fault in the underconceptualisation of housing processes.</s><s xml:id="_uT9trSW">The issue is thus essentially an epistemological one rather than one simply of approach.</s></p><p xml:id="_msXCTms"><s xml:id="_qUmD9aw">Two approaches to housing finance <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Malpass et al. (1993)</ref> have suggested that much of the work in housing finance falls within two approaches, which whilst they are not totally separated, are quite distinct.</s><s xml:id="_MDPBXEP">They suggest that much work can be described as applied economics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Garnett et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gibb and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Munro, 1991 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hills, 1991)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gwqrDTH">This approach can be said to be concerned with rent and subsidy levels, the operation of markets and the role of government as regulator, or put another way, with outcomes and the regulation of outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_SWEBmK5"><s xml:id="_jrEh7MH">This they contrast with what could be called the policy approach <ref type="bibr">(Malpass and Means, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Malpass et al., 1993)</ref> which is "concerned with issues of implementation as well as policy design: it is concerned with central-local government relations and with the politics of policy as well as the measurement of outcomes" <ref type="bibr">(1993, p. 8)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CaUzA4n">The policy approach is thus concerned more with the process that leads to particular outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_Y3gybVy"><s xml:id="_6PTDDYU">In essence these two approaches are concerned with the same issues, of production, consumption and distribution of housing resources.</s><s xml:id="_8Sb2k4n">The distinction comes in the particular area of analysis they consider to be important.</s><s xml:id="_aUeMfPw">The applied economic approach is more concerned with the outcome of processes whilst the policy approach is concerned with how outcomes are achieved through a deeper understanding of how processes operate.</s><s xml:id="_r7HEJKJ">It is possible to suggest therefore that these two approaches are not mutually exclusive, but are in fact complementary to each other.</s><s xml:id="_Wn69UQR">They concentrate on different aspects of the same process and there is a considerable overlap in their basic assumptions.</s><s xml:id="_t7F5reF">They also share some of the same problems.</s></p><p xml:id="_mkJ9krS"><s xml:id="_5AShHTF">Initially there appears to be an inherent understandability which frames the applied economic and policy approaches.</s><s xml:id="_X6urgYK">Indeed they appear to fit intuitively within the frame of reference in which housing discourse most comfortably sits.</s><s xml:id="_jwgTCun">Discussions on provision, consumption and the role of government in fostering, limiting and controlling provision and consumption are seen as the 'natural' domain for housing discourse.</s><s xml:id="_GEWHqvD">This may be because discourse mirrors policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kemeny, 1992)</ref> where housing policy is subservient to economic policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(King, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Muellbauer, 1990)</ref>, policy making itself is nationalised and local power emasculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Jenkins, 1995)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NKPFSHV">One could suggest therefore that there is an apparent correspondence between discourse and reality which, of course, ought to be the responsibility of researchers to achieve or at least aspire to.</s><s xml:id="_rHJQKRy">However, as policy is disseminated through the very discourse which seek to describe, comment on and criticise it, we could equally say that this correspondence is merely the result of a circular and thus self-justifying logic.</s><s xml:id="_XZj3pvF">These approaches are thus not corresponding to anything but their own analytical limits.</s><s xml:id="_8dhsVQC">My aim is to look beyond these limits and suggest areas of weakness.</s></p><p xml:id="_H7qgz22"><s xml:id="_EGpmYwU">The applied economic approach is currently the most significant, both in terms of existing texts and weight of analysis.</s><s xml:id="_sV3GWdB">It is a wide-ranging approach incorporating market-oriented discussions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Albon and Stafford, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Black and Stafford, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Minford et al, 1987)</ref> through to Marxian critiques <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ball, 1983)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TFqwhKA">This approach can also be said to dominate recent comparative housing research <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barlow and Duncan, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">McCrone and Stephens, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Oxley and Smith, 1996)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_m7d7FZq">In addition most of the standard housing finance textbooks take this approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Garnett et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gibb and Munro, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hills, 1991)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_BJz9EAy"><s xml:id="_wnefuwV">The applied economic approach tends to emphasise the outcomes of policy in terms of production and consumption, and the regulation of outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_AQnYvvu">It is therefore largely a quantitative approach, rather than the more qualitative methods used by the policy approach.</s><s xml:id="_hmp5nWv">The approach tends to emphasise quantifiable outcomes, for example of the level of investment, and then seek to understand the reasons which may account for differences over time or across countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Smith, 1997)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SH743mD">Indeed this approach tends to dominate the comparative housing literature in which the measurement of key aggregates is seen as the means of determining significant convergences and divergences.</s><s xml:id="_VUJruSw">Thus one of the strengths of the applied economic approach, in its macro-economic form, is its ability to measure differences between different policy processes in different countries.</s></p><p xml:id="_qnUsxzk"><s xml:id="_qs28kzK">The applied economic approach also offers useful insights into the roles of both the state and the market.</s><s xml:id="_BrTKVyg">This approach has yielded some highly developed models of how housing markets succeed or fail to meet certain targets presumed to be desirable <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barlow and Duncan, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Maclennan, 1982</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Maclennan, , 1997;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Oxley and Smith, 1996)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zhrWMhb">Through a discussion of the structural limitations of markets, such analyses can offer insights into the role of the state as regulator and provider of housing.</s><s xml:id="_NzshXqj">Perhaps more rarely critics of government intervention such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albon and Stafford (1987)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Minford et al. (1987)</ref> are able to show the limitations of government and how increased use of markets might enhance choice and efficiency.</s><s xml:id="_XvmcTNH">Thus through the modelling of housing systems the applied economic approach can offer crucial insights into the role of the state and the market.</s></p><p xml:id="_7QCptZq"><s xml:id="_j2ahdTW">A further insight offered by this approach is that it seeks to demonstrate the effects of incentives and motivation.</s><s xml:id="_Rc88DMM">For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albon and Stafford (1987)</ref> are concerned with modelling the micro-economic relations of supply and demand and how government regulation in the form of rent control affects this relationship.</s><s xml:id="_FDpA3r2">They suggest that rent control has led to a drop in supply and an increase in informal and illicit market activity as tenants and landlords moderate their behaviour in the light of government regulation.</s><s xml:id="_Uq2gYWF">This argument has some veracity in that it shows how government action can affect incentives on both the supply and demand side.</s><s xml:id="_8aWmmJz">Landlords, because they in effect pay the subsidy to their tenants, have a reduced incentive to supply sufficient dwellings to the requisite quality, whilst the demand for dwellings is increased because of the supply leading to the development of informal, non-market means of accessing dwellings.</s></p><p xml:id="_UZS8P3b"><s xml:id="_kbgNYqQ">However, whilst this micro-economic approach is useful, it suffers from some oversimplistic assumptions which show the limitations of this approach.</s><s xml:id="_ZTEzuHS">In particular Albon and Stafford, in accordance with neo-classical economic orthodoxy, assume individual actors act rationally and in isolation.</s><s xml:id="_ymhq9Gh">Even <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Maclennan (1982)</ref>, who develops a more sophisticated economic model of choice and decision making in housing markets which allows for imperfect market signals, appears to insist on rationality as the determinant for action.</s></p><p xml:id="_QSPj4PR"><s xml:id="_kfnsK85">However, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Clark (1992)</ref> has argued, any economic theory which relies on universal axioms and ignores societal influences and historical antecedents is likely to lack realism.</s><s xml:id="_ZXmZN6c">It reduces complex phenomena to simple cause and effect which can be predicted through economic science.</s><s xml:id="_6NWD25z">The result is that the model of the sovereign rational economic actor is an overidealised one which fails to appreciate the complex and irrational nature of human behaviour which operates within the constraints of social rules.</s><s xml:id="_U7YaxsB">The "Robinson Crusoe" approach of the generalised atomistic individual weighing up the most rational preference consistent with an objective self-interest, whilst possibly assisting in identifying the abstract rights of individuals and the manner in which individual behaviour is modified by changes in economic signals, falls down once one places the individual within a community whose influence is both undefinable and without conscious limits.</s><s xml:id="_EqJEXWw">Individual action is not constrained and this is precisely because individuals operate within complex extended orders where they have only a limited ability to affect change <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hayek, 1960</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hayek, , 1967</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hayek, , 1982))</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_XwZVqa2"><s xml:id="_zYa2e8n">However, the majority of housing finance texts cited above adopt a macroeconomic approach.</s><s xml:id="_BdRb6vs">They tend to take a more benign view of government action as being necessary to adjust certain market imperfections and to ensure that wider social policy aims are met (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barlow and Duncan, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hills, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Oxley and Smith, 1996)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XExKqq5">These approaches tend to concern themselves with aggregate notions of demand, need and supply and how government may assist or hinder the achievement of normative levels of provision and consumption.</s><s xml:id="_tEEBeyF">I would suggest that this too is an oversimplified view of the relationships within housing systems.</s><s xml:id="_beR4Ut5">It is proposed that government action, of itself, can determine these relationships and thus reduces micro-level action to ciphers for macro-level imperatives.</s><s xml:id="_JysMFDk">It is where entities which are properly individual -the housing of individual households -are aggregated into the notion of the 'nation's housing stock'.</s><s xml:id="_fnQR3Yx">The result of this nationalisation of individual assets and rights is to imply that individual action is determined through central

population.</s><s xml:id="_F5yZP96">There is simply no means to calculate and co-ordinate to ensure that the ends of individuals are met for them.</s><s xml:id="_b2AtZFY">A central planning agency can simply never know enough to ensure that its outcomes match its planned intentions.</s></p><p xml:id="_Em2A8n4"><s xml:id="_bHNTsFX">The reference to the 'national stock', and thus to housing as a

certain groups may be raised; the dwellings of inner-city owner-occupiers and landlords may be compulsorily purchased and then demolished; and tenants may be placed on probation and then evicted if

distribution.</s><s xml:id="_cCxJPVC">There is thus a presumption of the 'greater good' which may legitimately override the interests of individuals.</s><s xml:id="_dYAQd2M">This presumption of 'national' authority over the housing of individuals is the practical operation of the communitarian conception of the competence of the state to determine the interests of the community which is at the heart of both conservatism <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Scruton, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Willetts, 1992)</ref> and social democracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Etzioni,

would suggest that they fail to concern themselves with four substantive areas and as a result they are incapable of dealing with housing phenomena in their full complexity.</s><s xml:id="_KAvjSnh">By concentrating on these areas I can suggest the essential elements of an alternative, or perhaps better described as an additional, approach to the study of housing phenomena.</s></p><p xml:id="_V7jRmNH"><s xml:id="_csTn4sn">Firstly, we have seen that they fail to recognise this very complexity of processes themselves through the adoption of simplistic predictive models of economic and social interaction.</s><s xml:id="_n3WfmuY">These take the form of either economic rationality or the linear relationship of government with other collectivities.</s><s xml:id="_sqCq3UF">There is thus a need to see housing phenomena within a complex social order that operates through mechanisms which many, if not all, of the players fail to fully comprehend <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hayek, 1967</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hayek, , 1988))</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VAynvHW">Thus an approach is needed which does not call for 'better' government intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Williams, 1997)</ref> but rather sees its epistemological limits.</s></p><p xml:id="_pNytfGM"><s xml:id="_z9ss5QY">Secondly, the mainstream approaches fail to account for the effect of individual action.</s><s xml:id="_egfX2Sy">They do not particularly seek to define the role of the active individual.</s><s xml:id="_GqtTefe">However, even when they do, in the case of micro-economic analyses such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Albon and Stafford (1987)</ref>, they do not seek to individuate action according to normative or subjective notions of rationality which take into account perceptions and expectations.</s><s xml:id="_9WdrS5m">Instead the oversimplistic rational model common to orthodox economic theory is applied.</s><s xml:id="_Zj28TS8">Thus we need an approach which sees individual action as both differentiated and subjective according to individual ends.</s></p><p xml:id="_7dHMjvH"><s xml:id="_M5XqCBE">Thirdly, neither the applied economic nor the policy approaches attempt to explain the formation and development of processes and systems.</s><s xml:id="_j4886Zr">These processes and systems are seen as givens (and thus any development is generated internally) and what is studied is their operation.</s><s xml:id="_uVMV7Nv">In effect analysis is only attempted regarding the operation within the system.</s><s xml:id="_96yjuw8">There is an inability to get beyond the realm in question to determine the manner in which systems may form and develop <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Nozick, 1974)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rqmWjwm">Thus the systems are explained merely in terms of their own parts or ends, rather than by the instrumental effect they may have within the wider social order.</s><s xml:id="_HJQc7p7">Therefore an alternative approach would see housing as a means to the fulfilment of particular ends, be they of the state, institutions or individual households.</s></p><p xml:id="_npfQmq5"><s xml:id="_DXpAKUG">A further effect of this failure is that elements of the system are either seen as natural or necessary and thus normative notions about the extent of markets and governments can be restated as technical criteria of efficiency or distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Albon and Stafford, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barlow and Duncan, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hills,

xml:id="_jbdHaAX">Fourthly, there is either a failure to consider the cross-over effects and unintended consequences of action, or an inability to fully consider the implications of these effects for the policy process.</s><s xml:id="_hTgqdZb">This is in turn due to a failure to fully understand the openness of systems to influence from other areas with a complex social order.</s><s xml:id="_rSCmxte">Thus it is an error to consider housing phenomena in isolation from wider notions and to model the housing process as constitutive of its own motivation.</s><s xml:id="_Whg33Wm">The root of this problem is that housing policy is all too frequently discussed as nationally focused government action.</s><s xml:id="_UvPEp73">It is a top-down approach which gives too little attention to the context in which government operates.</s><s xml:id="_4A8X7S4">Indeed one can suggest the error arises because researchers confuse activity with competence.</s><s xml:id="_kMym4q8">Thus an

xml:id="_hqMhkPe">What this suggests, therefore, is an alternative approach to the study of housing finance (and by implication housing phenomena more generally) which recognlses the limits of government action and competence and which places the individual as an equal player along with government and agencies.</s><s xml:id="_4RBZWcW">It has been an attempt to show, through the deficiencies of constructivist methodologies, how a methodological individualist approach can offer greater insights into the relationship of households and their housing.</s><s xml:id="_BJ9JarG">This paper has
