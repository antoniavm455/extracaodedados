provides additional evidence that he is not a strict Kantian.</s><s xml:id="_3GJypNE">As we have just seen, Mises's position is that h u m a n beings must be treated as rational actors, since we do

meaningless.</s><s xml:id="_DnbUqC4">He instead adopted the more limited position that all scientific statements must be capable of being proved false.</s><s xml:id="_KGvFPdY">The theorems of praxeology, insofar as they are deductively derived from a self-evident axiom, fail this test: nothing can falsify them.</s><s xml:id="_kE2kCvJ">Mises's reply is characteristically forthright.</s><s xml:id="_8Xn6r4w">If Popper wishes to classify praxeology as unscientific, that is his affair.</s><s xml:id="_eYXY7Dd">The proper tests of praxeology are the truth of its axioms and the validity of its arguments.</s><s xml:id="_YX9wDg6">Why should it matter whether praxeology meets the criterion of science proposed by a particular writer?</s><s xml:id="_7cCYVwE">Why does it count against a statement that it is metaphysical in Popper's sense?</s></p><p xml:id="_AgwW9V9"><s xml:id="_uzQm8fq">Here once more Mises uses an ad hominem argument.</s><s xml:id="_M8NxRER">Like the positivists, Popper contended that definitions do not describe real essences: they are arbitrary proposals for the use of a term.</s><s xml:id="_wYzNq6y">23 Mises cleverly uses this view against Popper to show that his own characterization of scientific statements is an arbitrary proposal.</s></p><p xml:id="_FNjNKAh"><s xml:id="_SrvmFXN">Mises has another argument that uses positivist doctrine against itself.</s><s xml:id="_FGUqZEB">"[T]he proposition that there are no synthetic a priori propositions is itself a . . .</s><s xml:id="_GmdeJT6">synthetic a priori proposition, for it can manifestly not be established by experience.</s><s xml:id="_gbdAFQQ">"24 A positivist might deny this and assert that the claim was an inductive generalization.</s><s xml:id="_22g3jJ3">But then what justifies him in rejecting standard examples of a priori propositions, e.g., "whatever is colored is extended," not to mention the theorems of praxeology?</s><s xml:id="_AJa2hBX">Alternatively, a positivist might claim that the disputed statement is analytic, but it is unclear what would ground this assertion.</s></p><p xml:id="_kCpBUrN"><s xml:id="_c2pTPnH">Mises does not confine his criticism to refutations of the kind just described.</s><s xml:id="_2CvX6Zt">He directly examines the main contentions of the logical positivists and finds them wanting.</s><s xml:id="_QPgFCUj">The positivists claim that the propositions of mathematics and logic are tautologies.</s><s xml:id="_tfyUCFh">But even if this is true, we can learn something new from mathematical or logical investigation.</s><s

type="formula">28</ref>Mises's criticism of the positivists seem eminently well taken; but even if one adheres to that philosophy, Mises has the resources to protect praxeolog:y: He calls the propositions of economics synthetic a priori truths, but it is not at all clear t h a t he has in mind what the positivists wish to exclude.</s><s xml:id="_R2aauF9">What does Mises mean by a "synthetic" proposition?As discussed above, he replies to the claim that mathematical propositions are tautologies with the point that we can learn something new from some tautologies.</s><s

foes.</s><s xml:id="_UrHYx3W">They are concerned to exclude propositions that, in their sense of the terms, are both necessary and non-analytic.</s><s xml:id="_6xA48H5">So far as I can determine, Mises did not take a position on this issue; he neither asserts nor denies, e.g., that the predicate of the action axiom is "contained" in the subject.</s><s xml:id="_6B7DQfe">He offers no formal account of synthetic propositions, however, so the suggestion that praxeology is immune from positivist attack in this way is conjectural.</s></p><p xml:id="_RMkDQGF"><s xml:id="_EPN3XjT">Even if this suggestion is rejected, much of praxeology is still under no threat from the positivists.</s><s xml:id="_EanCW9K">Although "[a]ll the concepts and theorems of praxeology are implied in the concept of human action," its inquiries are restricted "to the study of acting under those conditions and presuppositions which are given in reality.</s><s xml:id="_Na3augg">"27 To accomplish this, subsidiary postulates must be added to the axiom of action, e.g., the assumption that labor has negative utility.</s><s xml:id="_HbsTS87">But "It]he disutility of labor is not of a categorical and aprioristic character.</s><s xml:id="_gDzxmCY">We can without contradiction think of a world in which labor does not cause uneasiness, and we can depict the state of affairs prevailing in such a world.</s><s xml:id="_yjuGkNZ">"28</s></p><p xml:id="_QYpsGkZ"><s xml:id="_RRB9Vkh">If praxeology includes empirical propositions, why would positivists object to it?</s><s xml:id="_YEFfEqR">They do not reject the

logic and mathematics.</s><s xml:id="_E4DvwhE">It does not present an integrated system of pure aprioristic ratiocination severed from any reference to reality.</s><s xml:id="_v3juRkY">''~9 The only theorems of praxeology, then, that conflict with positivism are those that do not include any empirical propositions in their derivation.</s><s xml:id="_BktRWjd">Mises has powerfully argued that

course economists influenced by positivism have followed methods of inquiry radically at variance with Mises's precepts.</s><s xml:id="_SW7WWE2">Many of them place great reliance on empirical testing,

consistent with positivism, must not this argument be withdrawn?</s><s xml:id="_EAnJ9hn">As usual, Mises is on safe ground: all that is required is a modification of it.</s><s xml:id="_weX6WxB">Mises can pose this dilemma to positivist detractors: if praxeology contradicts their views, its existence as a science refutes them; if it does not, they cannot object to it.</s><s xml:id="_ShEy4K9">And in any case, Mises still has intact all his other arguments against the positivists.</s></p><p xml:id="_YAXX4pE"><s xml:id="_AgqBJrd">Mises's primary aim in epistemology, I have endeavored to show, was

dismissing objective ethics, Mises has prepared the way for his own defense of the free market.</s><s xml:id="_sfkAcnP">Mises's primary concern to vindicate economics suggests an additional motive for his subjectivist conception of values.</s><s xml:id="_5yhnQzn">Someone who believes in objective values in the style of G. E. Moore but also accepts Austrian economics needs to fit two different kinds of value into his intellectual system.</s><s xml:id="_vAZZbby">By accepting only subjective values, a drastic intellectual simplification becomes possible; and Mises may have found the temptation to wield Occam's razor too strong to resist.</s><s xml:id="_mzw9tMB">More prosaically, as an economist Mises was thoroughly familiar with subjective values and may have found any other approach conceptually uncomfortable.</s><s xml:id="_DkM5NJj">This in part accounts for the fact that Mises says little to support his condemnation of objective values: he treats the issue as virtually self-evident.</s></p><p xml:id="_SxsFH4g"><s xml:id="_vPampNZ">Although Mises does not usually address in detail the arguments of value-objectivists, on one occasion he does so, with illuminating results.</s></p><p xml:id="_g6aJSEt"><s xml:id="_cxEMmWg">The political philosopher Leo Strauss claimed that many terms in our language fuse descriptive and evaluative components.</s><s xml:id="_5ZHGAD4">If, one calls someone cruel, the judgment rests on factual criteria.</s><s xml:id="_3tRNhaC">Stalin acted cruelly, e.g., in bringing about the death of millions of Russian peasants.</s><s xml:id="_uwhTTyV">This judgment is not, to reiterate, a matter of subjective assessment; but is objective in exactly the same way as "Stalin was Lenin's successor."</s><s xml:id="_ugY7wXX">Yet to call someone cruel implies a negative evaluation of him.</s><s xml:id="_wgDXy62">Thus, contrary to the value subjectivists, language imposes certain value judgments on us.</s><s xml:id="_yfXG8gq">To maintain that all values are subjective is to ignore for a large number of terms the criteria our language establishes.</s></p><p xml:id="_dDM5SZ6"><s xml:id="_rmKPMgr">Mises vigorously dissented.</s><s xml:id="_PsQyH7Q">He considered three examples given by Strauss: "cruelty," "prostitute," and "pressure group.</s><s xml:id="_WkSCjYU">"36 In each instance, Mises maintained, one can either use the term in question in a value-neutral way or substitute another term that lacks the value-charged nature of the original.</s><s xml:id="_8y8evE5">It is thus false that linguistic considerations prevent one from separating fact and value.</s><s xml:id="_sdQSGrU">This is not the place for an assessment of the dispute.</s><s xml:id="_fXaZBjd">Rather, it is the existence of the dispute itself that merits notice.</s><s xml:id="_43kb4Ae">During the late 1950s and early 1960s one of the most important arguments in modern moral philosophy took place between Philippa Foot and Elizabeth Anscombe, on the one hand, and R.
