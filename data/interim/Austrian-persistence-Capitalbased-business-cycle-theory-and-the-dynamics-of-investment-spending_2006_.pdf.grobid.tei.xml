<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2." xml:id="_HfxKZHR">The neoclassical theory of investment spending</head><p xml:id="_TGSxNMe"><s xml:id="_GA97abC">The most influential empirical work on investment expenditures to date is based on the pioneering studies of Dale Jorgenson and his successors (Jorgenson 1963, 1965, 1967, 1971;  Jorgenson and Stephenson 1967; Bischoff 1971).</s><s xml:id="_8aVQsB2">In the present paper, empirical results of others that have been obtained using Jorgenson's approach and its variants are used as benchmarks.</s><s xml:id="_B5qeGqb">Accordingly, a thorough review of it is useful.</s></p><p xml:id="_nPggpRZ"><s xml:id="_5RVgRJz">Empirical studies of investment spending typically consist of, [a] a theory of the determination of the desired capital stock (K * ), <ref type="bibr">3 and [b]</ref> a procedure for implementing the theory empirically by expressing current investment as a function of current and past values of the desired capital stock.</s><s xml:id="_6EbMMaV">Prior to Jorgenson's contribution, the standard empirical investment model was the [fixed] accelerator model, in which the firm's desired capital stock was assumed to be a fixed function solely of the current level of economic activity (typically represented by output).</s><s xml:id="_juwGqrW">The fixed-accelerator approach was not based on the standard optimization paradigm of the orthodox theory of the firm.</s><s xml:id="_WdPg5uW">Using dynamic optimization methods, Jorgenson developed a flexible accelerator model which was so based, in which the relationship between the capital-goods demand and output varied with the cost of capital.</s><s xml:id="_2886Zr3">Jorgenson's expression for the typical firm's optimal capital stock level (K * )is</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">K t * = γ p t Y t c t</formula><p xml:id="_m5THgJy"><s xml:id="_99FFPxT">where GAMMA is a parameter, p t is the price of output, Y t is output in real terms, and c t , the cost of capital, includes interest rates, depreciation allowances, corporate tax rates, and investment tax credits (see Bernanke et al. 1988, 321 for details of the expression for c t ).</s></p><p xml:id="_NB6TH9K"><s xml:id="_5GusM36">As often is the case in empirical macroeconomics, reasonable people can differ about the adequacy of the model's assumptions.</s><s xml:id="_FGXNspP">For example, when Jorgenson's K * measure is placed into the empirical implementation of the model, a framework is created whereby "investors' views of the future are grounded in their previous experience" (Kopcke 1993, 10).</s><s xml:id="_6vD8Zbn">But how should past experience be translated in the model into expectations of future events?</s><s xml:id="_RBTSCJ8">Direct observation of such anticipations is not possible: In their empirical implementation, therefore, "models of investment spending use [present and past] realized sales and costs as surrogates for the unobserved expectations" (ibid.).</s><s xml:id="_xT6B77d">In recent years, this feature of the model has been criticized for not being derived in a manner explicitly based on "rational"-expectations reasoning.</s><s xml:id="_Qpz35zT">Questions such as whether firms perceive a just-implemented investment tax credit, a sudden surge in demand, or a change in interest rates to be temporary or permanent are unaddressed by the model's expectations assumptions.</s><s xml:id="_CWu9QT3">So is the question of whether firms might anticipate future changes in policy based on current information and change behavior based on that anticipation.</s></p><p xml:id="_Dzk4vME"><s xml:id="_YsBezbs">Clearly, these are significant issues, and an empirical model should, ideally, incorporate them into its framework.</s><s xml:id="_vCDCpTP">However, in empirical work-and especially in applied macroeconomics-one must beware lest the best be the enemy of the good.</s><s xml:id="_kJRzJbg">As Kopcke  (1985a, 23) points out, if the processes generating variables like expected future prices, expected future interest rates, and expected future tax rates are not well-understood, then incorporating them into an empirical model by imposing a restrictive structure on that model can reduce, not increase, a model's ability to accurately capture the behavior of investment expenditures. <ref type="bibr">4</ref></s><s xml:id="_wyFexBU">For example, it is difficult to argue that firms would be particularly good at anticipating future tax changes over much of the period studied here.</s><s xml:id="_8Gr9g6e">A reading of Kopcke's  (1985b) thorough review of the many corporate tax changes from 1954 to 1984 suggests that many [most?]</s><s xml:id="_qrUwVk9">tax changes in the period would have been difficult to anticipate even by "rational" firms. 5</s><s xml:id="_ryzC5wH">Under these circumstances one would expect businesses to treat most tax changes as fairly transitory, and to be skeptical of forecasts of future policies.</s><s xml:id="_QM5aRAd">If tax policy is quite difficult to forecast accurately, then the question of "rationality" of forecasting method is less significant.</s><s xml:id="_vm3CgvQ">A similar argument might be made for firms' ability to accurately forecast future long-term interest rates. <ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_6aWmgRJ">orgenson's careful attention to the theory of the firm's desired capital-stock contrasts sharply with the atheoretical way in which he modeled how changes in K * at one point in time would translate into future investment expenditures.</s><s xml:id="_DTAHcR8">Jorgenson could have treated the speed of investment's response as an additional decision variable.</s><s xml:id="_qqY3xv4">Instead (and understandably), he chose not to impose theory on a time-intensive process that, then as now, was not well-understood. <ref type="bibr">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_SS4kZNr">In his model's empirical implementation, Jorgenson essentially regressed current and past values of his measure of capital-goods demand against current investment 4 One reason why is that "rational" expectations models consistently assume away the vital (but mathematically daunting) question of optimal information collection on the part of rational agents operating in a world characterized not just by uncertainty but also by non-trivial costs of acquiring and processing information.</s><s xml:id="_9UCuynW">Austrian economists have been especially cognizant of such problems (cf.</s><s xml:id="_mhJN23P">Garrison 2001, Ch. 2).</s><s xml:id="_AucD63F">There also are well-known modeling tradeoffs: No "rational" expectations model of the investment process has yet been constructed that matches Jorgenson's model merely in incorporating separately all of the different types of taxes facing the business firm in the real world-a major advantage offered by Jorgenson-type models in carrying out empirical work. <ref type="bibr">5 Between 1954</ref></s><s xml:id="_VYjjfrB">Between 1954<ref type="bibr">and 1984</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Kopcke (1985b)</ref> reports passage of eleven separate major new tax bills plus two suspensions of key components of tax bills already in force (about one event every two-and-a-quarter years).</s><s xml:id="_J6qesmE">Most involved changes in two or more of the separate tax "levers" affecting the cost of capital to business, making it difficult for business to anticipate the "mix" of tax changes that would be adopted the Federal government.</s><s xml:id="_vfAPNfb">In at least five cases, tax changes that seemed bound to happen judging by Administration rhetoric were delayed or not implemented.</s><s xml:id="_6XZMhbc">In addition, writing just prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Kopcke (op.</s><s xml:id="_KPzj9TQ">cit., 19) summarizes five quite different tax-reform proposals that were then receiving wide attention, arguably leaving business at sea as to what form the new Act would take.</s><s xml:id="_g8k5zWX">The empirical significance of "rational" expectations forecasting seems less in such a "noisy" tax-policy environment. <ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_G3jQfF5">The lessons of the 1970s, where simple "adaptive" expectations formulations of inflationary expectations were found to be wanting, should be applied to the Jorgenson framework with caution.</s><s xml:id="_7PcREwm">The "adaptive" expectations framework seeks to forecast future inflation purely on the basis of past values of inflation, leaving out many important factors likely to be known by forecasters and used to improve on adaptive forecasts.</s><s xml:id="_UeEh4Da">By contrast, Jorgenson's framework includes current and past values of most of the crucial variables likely to affect a firm's investment decision.</s><s xml:id="_em9SDUZ">This is quite a bit more sophisticated than "adaptive" expectations.</s><s xml:id="_JzXrpZa">Many of the factors necessary to form a "rational" presentation are present in the Jorgenson framework, albeit in unstructured form. <ref type="bibr">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_sa3NvYq">In his review of econometric studies of investment, Jorgenson stated that "the most important current problem is the integration of the time structure of the investment process into the representation of technology" (Jorgenson 1971, 1142).</s><s xml:id="_ySNerum">The problem has yet (2006) to be resolved (it is hoped that the present paper is a step towards a resolution).</s><s xml:id="_eEXmFVG">Oliner et al. (1995) compare the empirical performance of Jorgenson's approach with other, more recent "Euler equation" models that present a unified theory of capital-goods demand and the time structure of investment spending in an explicit "rational" expectations framework.</s><s xml:id="_xkdmXmh">Oliner et al. find that Jorgenson-type models outperform empirically the newer, more theoretically ambitious, models.</s><s xml:id="_QqbduYd">The Jorgenson/Bischoff approach also performs well when compared against older popular models (Accelerator, Tobin's "Q") that also do not model the time structure theoretically (e.g., Bernanke et al. 1988; see also Naylor  1985).</s><s xml:id="_PATsk9W">Springer spending.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref></s><s xml:id="_CruWHdD">His empirical model of the investment-spending process is</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I t = α + N i=0 β s pY c t-s + u t</formula><p xml:id="_g6hyERg"><s xml:id="_W6ABGv3">where ALPHA and BETA are parameters, DELTA is the "change in" operator, and u t is a random error term.</s><s xml:id="_SEWzbMs">Investment spending is predicted to depend on current and past values of the desired capital stock (K * ) in a fashion constrained only by the form and components of K * (and any additional restrictions imposed for technical econometric reasons as described in Note 8).</s><s xml:id="_FtZuEgs">Jorgenson's model and its offshoots give great leeway for the data itself to "select" the length and shape of the "investment-spending lag" (or "distributed lag")-terms denoting the drawn-out, hump-shaped way in which investment spending responds over time, in econometric studies, to changes in the desired capital stock.</s><s xml:id="_tWSebXj">In these models, the underlying forces that are the cause of the lag (the "structure of the underlying model") is left open.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref></s><s xml:id="_zKGNhhQ">Accordingly, Jorgenson's modeling strategy can be thought of as a kind of semi-reducedform approach, in which the key determinants of investment spending over time are assumed known, but where the exact theoretical details creating the dynamic response are not specified.</s></p><p xml:id="_CBJW7ue"><s xml:id="_mbCTaC4">A popular offshoot of Jorgenson's "neoclassical" model of investment spending is Bischoff"s (1971) "modified neoclassical" model (for the equation see Bernanke et al. 1988;  the "modified neoclassical" regression equation does not have an intuitive interpretation and so is not presented here).</s><s xml:id="_bE58qpM">Noting that Jorgenson's K* expression is an amalgam of output, interest-rate, and tax effects, Bischoff developed a model with two distributed lags: one capturing the effect on investment of changes in output, the other capturing the effect on investment of changes in the tax and interest-rate "policy variables" taken together. <ref type="bibr">10</ref></s><s xml:id="_jAKe3E7">The model accordingly "permit[s] the firm to respond differently to a change in output than to a change in interest rates, taxes, or prices" (Kopcke 1985a, 22).</s><s xml:id="_FN85Bpe">Still, in the estimation process all policy-related effects remain lumped together.</s><s xml:id="_rGzcCgY">Both models therefore build in the assumption of a certain uniform response by investment spending to each of its main determinants.</s><s xml:id="_U6dWFDq">If the lag is primarily structural (not expectational) in nature, arising largely from inevitable delays due to the time-intensive nature of the capital-goods production process-as is implicit in the approach of the present paper-then this limitation of the models is not too important. <ref type="bibr">11</ref></s><s xml:id="_FKDBgnM">hat empirical findings do Jorgenson's and Bischoff's approaches generate?</s><s xml:id="_mqSyw8P">Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref> and<ref type="figure">2</ref> present results from two more-recent empirical studies by Bernanke et al. and Oliner et al.  that make use of both empirical models. 12</s><s xml:id="_m4CnCfp">Of the two, the "modified neoclassical" approach, which forges the closer connection between interest-rate changes and investment-spending changes, receives the primary emphasis.</s><s xml:id="_6gcEcqX">Jorgenson-type estimates provided by Bernanke et al.  for equipment also are included.</s><s xml:id="_9jXCPNY">The actual estimated equations and a detailed discussion of their properties are presented in the source studies and are not reproduced here. 13</s><s xml:id="_3asM7qK">11 Jorgenson's model and Bischoff's "modified neoclassical" model are still used by applied researchers to model investment dynamics.</s><s xml:id="_Rw9jFvs">Both retain considerable influence and are still among the best-known empirical models of investment spending.</s><s xml:id="_NYq5MS4">Even today, they provide empirical estimates that are among the best produced by models of the investment-spending process. <ref type="bibr">12</ref></s><s xml:id="_j2UQTnR">The Bernanke et al. (1988) and Oliner et al. (1995) studies are selected for several reasons.</s><s xml:id="_8uZneaK">First, they considerably overlap the 1961-91 period which is the focus of this paper.</s><s xml:id="_faq4hbK">Second, each is estimated without imposing a particular lag structure (such as the questionable Koyck/Almon lag procedure).</s><s xml:id="_5FqMHuT">Third, their results are fairly typical of work in this area.</s><s xml:id="_vcbFXsb">As is traditional in this (and much other) literature, data selection in these studies is determined largely by "data availability" (Bernanke et al. 1988, 306).</s><s xml:id="_GQ8tFvm">In macroeconomics, the relative paucity of data has more or less militated an emphasis on the availability criterion in sample selection.</s><s xml:id="_sQqDYzy">Recently, econometricians have given more attention to how features of the data itself might guide sample selection (see, for example, Spanos 1990, 347).</s><s xml:id="_At6zv2B">Such recommendations, to the extent they are correct, enhance the case for "episodic empiricism" (study of individual episodes) as important "checks" on traditional macroeconometric work. <ref type="bibr">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_4xE9Yph">Two "modified neoclassical" estimated lag-patterns and two Jorgenson-type patterns-two each for structures and equipment-are taken from the Bernanke et al. study.</s><s

and acceptable Durbin-Watson coefficients are reported by the authors.</s><s xml:id="_F7V3NgZ">Virtually all estimated coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level or better.</s><s xml:id="_ydWFZzp">No unusual features of the estimated equations are reported by the authors.</s></p><p xml:id="_n7pptur"><s xml:id="_bSmQvfT">The Oliner et al. study contributes two "modified neoclassical" estimated lag-patterns (one each for structures and equipment) and one Jorgenson-type lag-pattern for equipment (the authors' equation for structures performed poorly and was not selected for use here).</s><s xml:id="_b9uXJxw">Estimation is over the 1955:II-1992:IV period by Ordinary Least Squares supplemented by use of the Newey-West correction for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation in the standard error estimates.</s><s xml:id="_wxvec3x">The authors do not adjust directly for serial correlation in the data due to their strong suspicion that such serial correlation reflects specification error rather than serially-correlated errors in the "true" model (in effect, identifying such a specification error is the purpose of the present paper).</s><s xml:id="_x6jrNVW">OLS generates unbiased (though inconsistent) estimates and is therefore acceptable for purposes of the present paper, given that the Newey-West procedure has been used to correctly estimate standard errors (thus allowing accurate inference).</s><s xml:id="_mkbE3By">Reported R-squares of the equations are lower than those of Bernanke et al., likely due to the use of OLS vs. Bernanke's adjustment for autocorrelation.</s><s xml:id="_MwpbCPX">As with the Bernanke et al. study, a large majority of Oliner's reported lag coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level or better, and no unusual features of the estimated equations are reported by the authors.</s></p><p xml:id="_e6pVZAA"><s xml:id="_xxj4CjU">Both the Bernanke et al. and Oliner et al. studies truncate the lag at eleven quarters to handle degrees-offreedom problems, as an alternative to use of the questionable Koyck/Almon lag procedure.</s><s xml:id="_zby2h3y">The estimated coefficients are

[scaled] gross investment.</s><s xml:id="_xfGSEYR">Neither the gross-nor net-investment concept gives quite the concept needed here, so having both is a reasonable compromise (for more details, see Footnote 34 ).</s><s xml:id="_AqnHY8z">Additional technical details of the two studies are provided in the source papers.</s><s xml:id="_8FvnEbF">Equations for equipment outperform equations for
