deriving the predictable results of a central bank disruption of that equilibrium.</s><s xml:id="_4EmmcND">Thus, the canonical theory focuses on (1) the time structure of production, (2) the potential for credit inflation to alter the relative prices of current versus future goods, and (3) a misallocation of resources between production processes that require more or less time.</s><s

preference for present goods than future goods, which tends to raise the interest rate.</s><s xml:id="_Vgf7EgB">A low time preference (higher level of savings) shows a greater relative preference for future goods than for present goods, which tends to reduce the interest rate.</s><s xml:id="_NSx2pXT">Since the agents' decisions to save imply their consumption decisions, a fall in the market interest rate will tend to coordinate the investment profit promises of entrepreneurs in a more capital-intensive production structure with the time preferences of consumers intertemporally.</s><s

causes accounting losses in the most roundabout stages from final consumption.</s><s xml:id="_GSThwrg">It subsequently drives the rise in interest rates, even higher than before the credit expansion because 1) the premium for the expected loss of purchasing power and the risk of default increase; 2) entrepreneurs prefer to pay higher interest rather than lose what they have invested.</s><s

process, the quantity of fiat money is always determined by the decisions of governments and central banks, regardless of the desires and actions of the money demanders.</s><s xml:id="_HR9czNC">Money is routinely accepted as the final means of payment for all market participants, meaning that fiat money can be borrowed and spent in terms of monetary and credit inflation, regardless of demand.</s><s xml:id="_UTvNH83">As <ref type="bibr">Shostak (2000, p. 69)</ref> states, "What determines whether money M1, M2, and the other Ms are valid definitions is how well they correlate with

represent the amount of money in the economy available for immediate use in exchange.</s><s xml:id="_UGWewQx">The TMS is an imperfect attempt to provide a statistical measure of money consistent with the theoretical definition of money as the general means of exchange in society.</s><s xml:id="_PpGeqfb">According to Rothbard and Salerno's approach, the familiar sets of Ms (M1, M2 and M3) calculated by central banks exclude some items identifiable as money and others lacking the essential property of a general medium of exchange.</s><s xml:id="_NPEXN3D">As a general medium of exchange,
